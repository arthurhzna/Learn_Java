# Learn Java

This repository is for learning Java. It contains a collection of small example programs and exercises intended to help beginners practice core Java concepts such as basic syntax, input/output, arrays, collections, threads, and object-oriented programming. Use these files as references, modify them to experiment, and compile/run them locally to see how changes affect behavior.

If you're new to Java, start by opening `hello.java` and running it with `javac` and `java`. Try editing the code, recompile, and observe the output. This hands-on approach will help you learn faster than only reading tutorials.

Feel free to add your own examples, delete compiled `.class` files if you prefer, and keep this repo as your personal Java playground.
